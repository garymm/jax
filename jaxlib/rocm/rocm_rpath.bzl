"""Wrapper macros for ROCm wheel RPATH configuration.

When building wheels with rocm_path_type=link_only, Bazel sandbox rpaths
are stripped and replaced with wheel-relative paths so that .so files
find ROCm libraries at install time.

Usage in BUILD files:

    load("//jaxlib/rocm:rpath.bzl", "rocm_nanobind_extension")

    rocm_nanobind_extension(
        name = "_my_ext",
        srcs = ["my_ext.cc"],
        ...
    )
"""

load("//jaxlib:jax.bzl", "nanobind_extension")

_ROCM_LINK_ONLY = "@local_config_rocm//rocm:link_only"

_WHEEL_RPATHS = [
    "-Wl,-rpath,$$ORIGIN/../rocm/lib",
    "-Wl,-rpath,$$ORIGIN/../../rocm/lib",
    "-Wl,-rpath,/opt/rocm/lib",
]

def _wheel_features():

    })
